Please update the file at $VISUALIZATION_FILE by:
1. Replacing the title placeholder with a meaningful description of these changes
2. Filling in the commit stats (files: $FILES_CHANGED, additions: +$ADDITIONS, deletions: -$DELETIONS)
3. Creating business value cards that explain what these changes accomplish
4. Organizing file changes into logical categories
5. Including the actual diff content in the code-diff sections
6. Making the visualization focus on business/user value, not just technical details

Keep the existing HTML structure and JavaScript intact. Only update the placeholder content and data."
